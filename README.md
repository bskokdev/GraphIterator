# DFS & BFS Graph iterators

## Description
This project implements two graph iterators: DFS and BFS.
The graph is represented as an adjacency list using an unordered map.

## Pre-requisites
- C++ compiler version 17 or higher (g++) 
- CMake version 3.25 or higher

## Windows build & run
1. Open a terminal in the project root directory
2. Create a build directory: `mkdir build`
3. Change directory to the build directory: `cd build`
4. Run CMake: `cmake ..` or `cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..` to build Makefiles 
5. Run make: `make` to build the project
6. Run the executable: `./GraphIterators ../input.txt` (notice ../input.txt)
